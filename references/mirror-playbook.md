# KAGE — Mirror Playbook

The mirror is 1:1: every CONFIRMED attack gets exactly one rule; every rule names
its log source; every rule-only finding IS the deliverable (the defender cannot
see what they do not log).

## The purple contract
1. mirror: family CONFIRMED → rule (id, ATT&CK, log source, Sigma YAML)
2. telemetry: the registry of what the operator CAN see
3. validate: rc=1 while any rule lacks a live source — the gap list is the deliverable
4. report: the handoff artifact (rules + telemetry map)

## Rule quality bar
- One attack class per rule (no kitchen-sink detection).
- Match on BEHAVIOR (hash/window/diff), not indicators — rules survive tool swaps.
- Every rule carries a re-fire test: the family re-fires the attack read-only
  and the rule MUST fire; a rule that cannot fire is a hypothesis.
